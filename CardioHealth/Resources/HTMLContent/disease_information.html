            <p>Cardiovascular disease is often called “heart disease,” but it actually includes diseases of both the heart and your blood vessels.</p>
 			<p>Heart attacks are due to plaque buildup
in the small coronary arteries that supply blood to your heart. When they get blocked, your heart does not get enough blood and oxygen and your heart muscle cells can stop working and die. Disease of the blood vessels of your neck and brain can cause strokes, which is damage to your brain cells when they do not get enough blood and oxygen.</p>
			<p>Cardiovascular disease is mostly preventable, with physical activity being very important. So is a heart healthy diet, based mostly on plants rather than meat, and including whole grains and fish while minimizing carbohydrates. Being active and eating healthy can also prevent risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and abnormal cholesterol levels
in the blood. Quitting smoking is also very important. To learn more about coronary artery disease and stroke, visit the Stanford Health Care websites below.</p>
