            <h1>Eligibility</h1>
            <p>All adults over 18 years old and living in the United States are eligible. You must also have an iPhone 5s, 6, or 6 plus, as these have special motion sensors built in that do not drain your battery. Finally, you need to be able to read and understand English. Versions in other languages and for outside the U.S. will be available in the future.</p>
