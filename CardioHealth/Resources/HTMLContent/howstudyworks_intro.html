            <h1>How this Study works</h1>
            <p>If you provide consent, you will be asked to allow the <boldie>MyHeartCounts</boldie> app to collect health and activity data from your phone, followed by survey questions about any history of cardiovascular disease and risk factors. At the beginning of the study and every 3 months, the <boldie>MyHeartCounts</boldie> app will ask you to do 3 things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use your phone, or any wearable activity device you have, to collect activity data for 7 days;</li>
        		<li>Perform a 6-minute walk evaluation, which uses the phone (or wearable) to measure the distance you can walk in 6 minutes</li>
        		<li>Update your survey information about risk factors and any change in heart disease status.</li>                
          	</ol>
         	<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
            The <boldie>MyHeartCounts</boldie> app will provide feedback on all 3 items above: your 7-day activity level, your 6-minute walk distance, and your American Heart Association cardiovascular risk evaluation. The <boldie>MyHeartCounts</boldie> app will also provide educational links to learn more about any of your data. You are encouraged to continue to use the <boldie>MyHeartCounts</boldie> app in between the 3-month timepoints. At times during the study, the app may provide additional information about your heart risk and offer coaching or other aids to help increase your daily activity.
