 	<p style="padding-top:15px;">We view your privacy very seriously. Thus, we are requesting the least amount of personal data possible. Also, we are using strict security protocols to protect your data. Importantly, your name will be replaced with a random code before the data goes to the large computer for storage and later analysis. We cannot completely guarantee that someone cannot gain access to your private data, but importantly the main data storage is secure, encrypted, and does not contain your name.</p>
