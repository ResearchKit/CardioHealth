<p style="padding-top:15px;">We will ask you survey questions and have you use your phone or wearable
device to collect activity data for 7 days. You will also be asked to do a 6-minute walk test and
enter blood test data to determine your risk score. You can continue to use the app for activity
monitoring and it will ask to you update your data every 3 months.</p>
